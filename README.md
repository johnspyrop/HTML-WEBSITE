# HTML WEBSITE

In this mid-term project i was tasked to create a website for an aspiring mangaka using only HTML-CSS.


## Appendix

In order to enter comicdom, an international comics competition, one has to have their own website. In this project i created a website for my alter self, my mangaka persona. It consists of two pages, the home page and a contact me page. In the first one you will find info about my deep backstory and some of "my" artwork. On the second one you can fill out YOUR info, in case you want to get in contact with me.
